# NCCL Guide for DigitalOcean Bare Metal Machines

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library) on DigitalOcean bare metal machines with GPUs.

## Overview

NCCL is NVIDIA's library for multi-GPU and multi-node communication primitives that are performance-optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. This guide will walk you through the process of configuring and testing NCCL across multiple DigitalOcean bare metal instances.

## Understanding NCCL Tests

### What are NCCL Tests?

NCCL tests are benchmarking tools that validate and measure the performance of GPU-to-GPU communication using NVIDIA's NCCL library. These tests help ensure that your multi-GPU setup is working correctly and performing optimally.

### Intra-Node Testing

**Intra-node** testing refers to communication between GPUs within a single machine (node). This tests:

- **GPU-to-GPU communication** within the same server
- **PCIe bandwidth** and efficiency between GPUs
- **NVLink performance** (if available) for direct GPU-to-GPU connections
- **Memory bandwidth** and latency between GPUs on the same motherboard
- **Local NUMA effects** and CPU-GPU memory transfer rates

Intra-node tests are crucial for:
- Validating that all GPUs in a single machine can communicate effectively
- Measuring baseline performance before scaling to multiple nodes
- Identifying hardware issues like faulty PCIe slots or NVLink connections
- Optimizing GPU placement and affinity settings

### Inter-Node Testing

**Inter-node** testing refers to communication between GPUs across different machines (nodes) over the network. This tests:

- **Network bandwidth** between different servers
- **Network latency** and communication overhead
- **RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) performance** for GPU-to-GPU communication across nodes
- **RDMA capabilities** and network fabric efficiency
- **Scalability** of communication patterns as you add more nodes

Inter-node tests are essential for:
- Validating distributed training and multi-node workloads
- Measuring network bottlenecks in multi-GPU clusters
- Testing fault tolerance and network reliability
- Optimizing network topology and configuration
- Benchmarking real-world distributed computing scenarios

### Why Both Tests Matter

Running both intra-node and inter-node tests provides a complete picture of your GPU cluster's communication capabilities. Intra-node tests establish your baseline single-machine performance, while inter-node tests validate that your network infrastructure can effectively scale your workloads across multiple machines.

## Setting Up DigitalOcean Bare Metal Instances

### Step 1: Create GPU Instances

To get started with DigitalOcean bare metal GPU instances, you'll need to contact the sales team as these are specialized resources that require custom provisioning.

1. **Contact Sales Team**: Fill out the form at https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gradient/bare-metal-gpus?referrer=pdocs&utm_campaign=how-to-create-gradient-bare-metal-gpus#sales-form

2. **Review Documentation**: Refer to the official guide on creating bare metal GPU instances: https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/bare-metal-gpus/how-to/create/

3. **Instance Provisioning**: Once you've contacted sales and your requirements are approved:
   - The DigitalOcean team will create your bare metal GPU instances
   - You'll receive the necessary credentials and connection information
   - The instances will be configured with your specified GPU configuration

4. **What You'll Receive**:
   - SSH access credentials (private key or password)
   - IP addresses of your instances
   - Instance specifications and GPU configuration details
   - Network configuration information

> **Note**: Bare metal GPU instances are custom-provisioned resources and may take some time to set up. Plan accordingly and ensure you have your requirements clearly defined when contacting the sales team.
